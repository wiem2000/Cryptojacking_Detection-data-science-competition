# Cryptojacking Classification Project

This project was developed for a data science competition on Zindi, held during the Artificial Intelligence National Summit hackaton (AINS 2024), organized by IEEE 'Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es et de Technologie' (INSAT). We proudly secured the 12th position in the competition, which focused on detecting cryptojacking activities.

## Overview

The aim is to classify network activity from websites as either cryptojacking or not. The dataset includes various network-based and host-based features.

## Methods

We utilized multiple machine learning models, including:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Bayesian Optimization
- GridSearchCV

To improve the F1 score, we employed techniques like feature scaling, SMOTE for class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The data was provided by researchers from Universidad del Norte and Instituto Politecnico Nacional. Details can be found [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai-national-summit-2024-competition)
