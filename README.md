# Cryptojacking Classification Project

This project was developed during the Artificial Intelligence Tunisian Summit 2024, organized by IEEE Institut National des Sciences Appliquées et de Technologie (INSAT). It was part of a data science competition focused on detecting cryptojacking activities.
we secured the 12th position in the recent Machine Learning competition on Zindi!
The challenge, part of the hackathon at the Artificial Intelligence National Summit (AINS 2024) organized by the IEEE Insat club, focused on detecting CryptoJacking activities.
## Overview

The aim is to classify network activity from websites as either cryptojacking or not. The dataset includes various network-based and host-based features.

## Methods

We utilized multiple machine learning models, including:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Bayesian Optimization
- GridSearchCV

To improve the F1 score, we employed techniques like feature scaling, SMOTE for class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The data was provided by researchers from Universidad del Norte and Instituto Politecnico Nacional. Details can be found [here](link-to-competition-source).
